# ESP3D-Printer-v1.0

## OVERVIEW (BECAUSE EVERY GOOD PROJECT NEEDS ONE, RIGHT?)
Welcome to the **ESP3D-Printer-v1.0**, an **ABSOLUTELY EPIC**, borderline **UNSTOPPABLE** 3D printer controller designed specifically for the venerable **Tevo Tarantula**! (Yes, only that, because we have a very specific taste.) This project comes equipped with **ALL** the nerdy bells and whistles that any respectable DIY maker could possibly dream of. 

Brace yourself, because we’re going deep into the *3D printing rabbit hole*. This firmware is brought to you by the power of **Wi-Fi**, some **ESP32 magic**, a dash of **G-code wizardry**, and let’s not forget the mighty **belt drive** (because **gearboxes** are for casuals, right?). So buckle up and prepare for the nerdiest ride you’ll ever take in the world of DIY printing!

### CORE SPECIFICATIONS (A.K.A. THE MEATY STUFF)
- **ESP3D Firmware** — You heard that right, this bad boy runs on the mythical **ESP3D** firmware. Open source, of course. Because why keep all this glorious tech to ourselves when we can share it with the world?
- **Wi-Fi Powered** — Get rid of those pesky cables and embrace the untethered freedom of the airwaves! Your 3D printer is now a certified **Wi-Fi ninja**, thanks to the **ESP32’s** built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. Upload, manage, and monitor your prints without ever touching a USB cable.
- **12V 3A Power Supply** — We don't just run on power. We devour it. The **ESP3D-Printer** is juiced up with a robust **12V 3A power supply** to ensure your printer gets all the energy it needs to do what it does best: print stuff.
- **Node MCU ESP32S v1.1** — Not just any ESP32, oh no. We’re talking about the **Node MCU ESP32S v1.1**. This is the brains behind the operation, the nerve center, the *Einstein* of this entire contraption.
- **.gcode Parsing** — The printer is smart enough to parse `.gcode` files exclusively for the **Tevo Tarantula**. That’s right, it’s a machine built for precision. Don’t even think about throwing random files at it—unless, of course, you want to see it raise an eyebrow (digitally speaking, of course).
- **USB Webcam Support** — Because what’s a high-tech 3D printer without a **live stream** of the extruder doing its thing? Why wait for hours next to your printer when you can monitor it from your couch, sipping coffee and watching in glorious real-time as your masterpiece comes to life?
- **Belt Powered** — Forget lead screws. This baby runs on **belt drive** because we like speed and precision. The belt mechanism brings out the **Formula 1 racer** of 3D printers: quick, agile, and smooth. You can almost hear it vroom.

### GETTING STARTED (AKA WHY YOU SHOULD BE EXCITED)
If you’re the kind of person who gets a thrill from typing cryptic commands into terminals, **wiring up electronics** with pin-precise accuracy, and letting your friends know how inferior their off-the-shelf 3D printers are (and who doesn’t enjoy that?), then you’re going to **love** this project.

1. **Step One:** Burn the **ESP3D firmware** onto your **Node MCU ESP32S v1.1**. If you don’t know how to do that yet, it’s probably time to dive into a few ESP32 forums and get yourself acquainted with things like **UART**, **firmware flashing**, and **serial connections**.
   
2. **Step Two:** Get your printer connected to the **Wi-Fi** (because who wants to deal with physical USB drives in 2024?). Enter the SSID `automation` and password `automation`—yes, we keep it simple because we’ve got no time for complex Wi-Fi passwords. Your **ESP3D-Printer** should shout “**SUCCESS!**” across your network once it’s connected.
   
3. **Step Three:** Install a **USB webcam**. Sure, the print is going to take a while, but that’s what the webcam is for. Fire up a livestream of your print and revel in the sight of filament being extruded like a digital artist’s dream come true.

4. **Step Four:** Power it up using that sleek **12V 3A** power supply. We could’ve gone overboard with a 24V system, but 12V is classy, and this project is all about **elegance** in DIY engineering.

5. **Step Five:** Get the **Tevo Tarantula** ready! Why Tevo Tarantula, you ask? Because it's a workhorse, and if you’re going to use a platform, it might as well be **one of the best**.

### THINGS YOU’LL NEED TO TELL YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT (BRAGGING RIGHTS)
- **Firmware Name:** **ESP3D** (not to be confused with anything else, this is the definitive ESP32 3D printer firmware for true DIY geeks).
- **Wi-Fi Connectivity:** Yeah, it’s basically running over Wi-Fi. Your friend's wired printer is going to feel ancient next to this beast.
- **USB Webcam Support:** Because if you can’t watch your print remotely, does it even count as a **high-tech setup**?
- **Customizable Everything:** This firmware isn’t locked down. It’s like the Wild West of 3D printer firmware, and you’re the sheriff who gets to make all the rules.

### ASSEMBLY TUTORIAL (FOR THOSE WHO NEED TO VISUALIZE THEIR SUCCESS)

### LICENSE (BECAUSE WE’RE OPEN-SOURCE NERDS)
This project is open source under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Feel free to fork it, modify it, build upon it, or even just marvel at its code. Just remember, if you make something cool out of it, **let the world know**. And maybe shoot me a message. Because **geeky collaboration** is what makes the world go round.

### DISCLAIMERS (BECAUSE LAWYERS, AM I RIGHT?)
- This firmware is for **Tevo Tarantula** only. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.
- If your print starts smoking or otherwise **misbehaves**, don’t panic. That’s what firmware updates are for. Also, fire extinguishers.
- Not responsible for failed prints, missed Wi-Fi connections, or webcam streams that make your friends jealous.

Welcome to the future of **DIY 3D printing**. You’re officially one step closer to nerd nirvana. **Enjoy the ride**.
