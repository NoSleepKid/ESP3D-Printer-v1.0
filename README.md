# ESP3D-Printer-v1.0

## OVERVIEW (BECAUSE EVERY GOOD PROJECT NEEDS ONE, RIGHT?)
Welcome to the **ESP3D-Printer-v1.0**, the ultimate 3D printer controller built **from the ground up** with surgical precision, honed by countless hours of engineering wizardry, and designed with one thing in mind: **performance**. This bad boy is unlike anything you’ve seen before. It’s a self-contained powerhouse, built specifically to **parse and execute** **Tevo G-code files** (*and ONLY Tevo G-code files*). That’s right, this controller doesn’t just print, it **prints with focus**, like a laser-guided missile locked onto your DIY dreams.

This project is packed with enough tech to make even the most seasoned nerd's heart skip a beat. It’s powered by **Wi-Fi**, with a robust 12V power system, an integrated USB webcam for real-time streaming, and a motorized belt system that brings out the true potential of 3D printing technology.

### WHY BUILD IT FROM SCRATCH? BECAUSE WE CAN.
Unlike other projects that **recycle off-the-shelf firmware** or slap together modules like Frankenstein, the **ESP3D-Printer-v1.0** was born from pure, unbridled **nerdy ambition**. We’re not here to make some *generic* firmware that can be used for anything. No, we are here to support **one specific purpose**—the **Tevo Tarantula G-code format**—because if you're going to do something, you might as well do it perfectly.

Brace yourself for the deep dive into what makes this project tick. If you’ve ever wondered what it would be like to harness the true power of **ESP32 Wi-Fi chips**, now is your chance. This is **DIY printing** taken to its **absolute limits**. Let’s geek out!

### CORE SPECIFICATIONS (A.K.A. THE MEATY STUFF)
- **ESP3D Firmware** — Let’s start with the brain of this operation. This isn’t your run-of-the-mill 3D printer firmware. **ESP3D** is an **open-source** marvel, coded with meticulous care to handle every nook and cranny of the Tevo G-code format. It’s lean, fast, and fully customizable.
- **Wi-Fi Powered** — Forget cables. This machine thrives on **Wi-Fi freedom**. With an ESP32 at the helm, it can connect to your network, manage G-code files, and stream live updates directly to your devices. The only wires you’ll need are the ones connecting your motors. Everything else? Done wirelessly.
- **12V 3A Power Supply** — We run on **serious juice**. The **12V 3A power supply** keeps everything running smooth, from the controller to the motors. No power hiccups. No under-voltage. Just pure, stable energy to drive your printer to perfection.
- **Node MCU ESP32S v1.1** — The ESP32 is the **brains** of the operation. And not just any ESP32—this is the **Node MCU ESP32S v1.1**—the **Rolls-Royce** of Wi-Fi-enabled microcontrollers. It’s equipped with **dual-core processing**, integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and can handle the G-code parsing like a pro.
- **Exclusive G-code Parsing** — Built from scratch with a laser-sharp focus on Tevo Tarantula G-code files. That’s right. This isn’t a printer for the masses. This is a **precision-engineered**, specialized tool for those who know the **Tevo Tarantula** inside and out.
- **USB Webcam Support** — Because we know you love watching your prints as they unfold in glorious real-time. Plug in a **USB webcam** and stream your progress like a pro. Whether it’s for diagnostics or just pure printing pleasure, the webcam is your window into the mesmerizing world of extrusion.
- **Belt Powered** — Forget lead screws. Lead screws are for printers stuck in the **past**. This bad boy runs on **belts**, delivering the kind of speed and precision you only find in racing cars. It’s fast, it’s smooth, and it’s **beautiful**.

### GETTING STARTED (AKA WHY YOU SHOULD BE EXCITED)
If your heart skips a beat when you hear the words **Wi-Fi flashing**, **motor control** or **G-code**, you’re in for a treat. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown of how to get your **ESP3D-Printer** up and running:

1. **Step One:** Flash the **ESP3D firmware** to your **Node MCU ESP32S v1.1**. Don’t know how? Time to dive into some **firmware flashing tutorials**. You'll need to connect your ESP32 via USB, fire up your favorite flashing software (be it **esptool**, **PlatformIO**, or even **Arduino IDE**), and load the **ESP3D firmware** into it like the seasoned pro you are.
   
2. **Step Two:** Assemble your **gantry**. That’s right, we’re not just talking about firmware here—you’ll be building the **physical skeleton** of the printer from scratch. Get your frame ready, assemble it with care, and get that **Tevo-ready belt drive** installed like a boss.
   
3. **Step Three:** **Add the motors**. No 3D printer is complete without a set of finely-tuned stepper motors to drive the action. Slot them into place, and don’t forget to connect them to your motor drivers like the master builder you are.

4. **Step Four:** **Wire it up**. This is where the fun really starts. Carefully route your wires, making sure everything is connected in perfect harmony. Whether you’re soldering or using connectors, make sure the **ESP32**, motors, and power supply are all in sync.
   
5. **Done!** That’s it. Flash. Assemble. Wire. **Print**. It’s that easy. If you follow these steps and fire up your printer, you’ll be on your way to **G-code nirvana**.

### THINGS YOU’LL NEED TO TELL YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT (BRAGGING RIGHTS)
- **Firmware Name:** **ESP3D** — This is not your typical firmware. It’s hand-crafted, custom-built, and optimized specifically for **Tevo G-code** files. If anyone asks, yes, it’s very exclusive.
- **Wi-Fi Connectivity:** Did I mention this thing runs on **Wi-Fi**? It connects seamlessly to your network and gives you **complete wireless control**. You can manage prints, monitor progress, and show off to your friends from anywhere. 
- **USB Webcam Support:** Watch in real-time as your **creation** takes form, layer by layer, via your high-tech webcam setup.
- **Customizable Everything:** The open-source firmware means you can tweak and modify to your heart’s content. Want more features? Add them. Want to tinker with the G-code parsing algorithm? Go ahead. It’s yours to play with.

### ASSEMBLY TUTORIAL (FOR THOSE WHO NEED TO VISUALIZE THEIR SUCCESS)
Not everyone can just read through technical specs and envision a fully assembled printer. If you need a **visual guide** to get your ESP3D-Printer up and running, check out my **YouTube tutorial**:

### DISCLAIMERS (BECAUSE LAWYERS, AM I RIGHT?)
- This firmware is built specifically for **Tevo G-code files**. It won’t work with your fancy other printer G-codes, no matter how much you want it to.
- If things go up in smoke or stop working unexpectedly, hey, that’s part of the journey. Just don’t say I didn’t warn you.
- I’m not responsible for any failed prints, messy wiring jobs, or Wi-Fi issues that make you question your entire existence as a maker.
